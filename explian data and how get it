## 🧐 What is this?
This project is an **AI Brain** trained to look at images of playing cards and identify them instantly. 
* **Input:** A photo of a card.
* **Output:** The name of the card (e.g., "Queen of Hearts").

## 📊 About the Data
I used a high-quality dataset from **Kaggle**. Here is what it contains:

| Item | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Images** | 8,000+ Pictures |
| **Categories** | 53 (All 52 cards + Joker) |
| **Image Size** | 224 x 224 pixels |

## 🛠 How it Works (Simple Steps)
1. **The Training:** I showed the AI thousands of card photos so it could learn the differences between "Spades", "Hearts", "Clubs", and "Diamonds".
2. **The Prediction:** Once trained, you can give it a **new photo** it has never seen, and it will guess the card.
3. **The Technology:** Built using **Python** 🐍 and **PyTorch** 🔥 (the gold standard for AI).
